## Loading and preprocessing the data


Firstly I load the dataset from the zip files. 
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("activity.zip")
```

Secondly I wanted to show some first elements of this dataset to get to know something about them. Of course I used the 'summary' and 'str' function to see some basics statistics.
```{r echo = TRUE}
summary(data)
head(data)
str(data)
```

Now I know that this dataset have a lot of NA rows. My goal is to recognize why this value is so common. Below I show how many this NA value are. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
Percentage_NA <- length(which(is.na(data$steps)))/length(data$steps)
print(Percentage_NA)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
